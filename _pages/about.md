Hello there! I'm a second-year neuroscience PhD student at UC Berkeley, advised by Drs. [Bruno Olshausen](https://redwood.berkeley.edu/) and [Jacob Yates](https://jake.vision/). My general interests lie in building biologically relevant models of vision, and my current work is focused on modelling early retinal processes during natural scene viewing. I'm also passionate about diversifying the field of computational neuroscience as well as 
[science communication](https://www.berkeleysciencereview.com/).

Before grad school, I received my Bachelor's in biomedical engineering from UT Austin (hook 'em!) and my Master's in medical sciences from Boston University. I then went onto work with Drs. [Paulo Lizano](https://lizanolab.com) and Matcheri Keshavan at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston analyzing neural, retinal, and inflammatory biomarkers of psychosis. There, my interest in vision research grew as well as an appreciation for translational research applications.

Outside of the office, you can probably find me enjoying a nice hike, listening to old desi music, fretting over my houseplants, or drawing.
