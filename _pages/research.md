## Retinal imaging biomarkers in psychotic disorders

During my time at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center (BIDMC), I mainly worked on projects trying to uncover and understand retinal biomarkers in psychotic
disorders, mainly schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Visual disturbances are commonly reported in patients with psychosis, and research has increasingly
shown that the [retina may provide key insights](https://academic.oup.com/schizophreniabulletin/article/47/3/577/6144974#google_vignette) into the pathophysiology
of psychosis. 

One of my main contributions was the development of a semi-automated pipeline (repo coming soon) to more accurately and efficiently extract microvascular
morphology measures from optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) images. Additionally, this pipeline allowed for better analysis between structural
OCT measures and microvascular data from OCTA scans.
