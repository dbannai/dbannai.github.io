Hello there! I'm a first-year neuroscience PhD student at UC Berkeley, and my general research interests focus on building biologically relevant models of vision. Currently, my rotation project focuses on how retinal output changes due to eye movements during natural scene viewing. I'm also very passionate about diversifying computational neuroscience and [science communication](https://www.berkeleysciencereview.com/).

Before grad school, I received my bachelor's in biomedical engineering from UT Austin (hook 'em!) and my master's in medical sciences from Boston University. I then went onto work with Drs. [Paulo Lizano](https://lizanolab.com) and Matcheri Keshavan at BIDMC/Harvard analyzing neuro- and retinal imaging biomarkers in psychosis. 

Outside of the office, you can probably find me enjoying a nice hike, listening to old desi music, fretting over my houseplants, and drawing.
